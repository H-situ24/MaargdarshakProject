                      Admission to IIM Bangalore is highly competitive,
                      especially for the PGP program. Candidates need to excel
                      in national-level entrance exams such as CAT, or GMAT for
                      the Executive programs. A well-structured study plan

                      process, requiring strong communication skills and a

                <p class="mb-20">
                  The Bachelor of Physiotherapy (BPT) is a 4.5-year
                  undergraduate degree program, including a six-month
                  internship, aimed at providing students with in-depth
                  knowledge and hands-on experience in the field of
                  physiotherapy. This program focuses on the assessment,
                  diagnosis, and treatment of physical impairments and
                  disabilities, aiming to improve patient mobility,
                  functionality, and quality of life.

                    <p>
                      To prepare for BPT exams, students should focus on
                      understanding core subjects like anatomy, physiology, and
                      biomechanics. Practical application through case studies,
                      clinical practice, and regular revision is essential for
                      success. Time management and practice of manual techniques
                      are also crucial.
